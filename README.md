### Hi there, I'm Max 👋

I'm an iOS engineer from Berlin, Germany. 

Currently I'm a platform engineer [@GetYourGuide](https://github.com/getyourguide) helping the iOS team scale and stream line the experience in [our app](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/getyourguide-tours-tickets/id705079381?l=en).

I'm a huge fan of the Swift programming language and really passionate about writting simple, intuitive and accessible code (and love the challenge of turning complex stuff into it).

Outside of programming, I like to ride single-geared bikes 🚴, walk long distances and get lost in nature 🚶‍♂️ and spin the decks with Techno, other electronic music and hip-hop 🎛.
